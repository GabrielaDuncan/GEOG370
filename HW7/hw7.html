<h1>Homework 7: Census Data Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Gabriela Duncan</h2>
<h3>I decided to pick Wisconsin, because I used to live there. From my time living there, I realized that there were not many other members of the Latinx community around me, so I wanted to see what the proportions were like in my state. As you can see from the map, Racine, Dane, Brown, Kenosha, and Milwaukee County had the highest populations of Latinx by far in comparison to the rest of the state.</h3>
