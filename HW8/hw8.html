<h1>Homework 8: Census Data Choropleths With Different Ratios and Categorizations </h1>
<h2>Gabriela Duncan</h2>
<h3>Original Map</h3>
<h4>I originally did Homework 7 with data of the population of Latinx population in the state of Wisconsin, but I was not able to use that data for this homework because it did not have the total populations in all of the counties. Instead, I decided to pick the state of Pennsylvania and look at the amount of people who had health insurance. Here is what the map looks like for reference.</h3>

<h3>Map #1: Equal Interval </h3>
<h4>This map shows little to no variance in ratios among the counties. As you can see from this map, Forest and Pike counties had the highest ratio of Coverage:Total by far in comparison to the rest of the counties. This is especially interesting to me because these counties are not even in the more urban areas of the state such as Philadelphia or Pittsburgh but rather in the more rural areas. I thought that the highest ratios would be in the more urban counties since there would be more access to resources to obtain health insurance.</h4>

<h3>Map #2: Natural Breaks </h3>
<h4>Of the three ratios, this map shows that there is a wider spread of data. That spread of data makes the map easier to read and understand. Even with this larger spread of data, it still shows that the urban areas have a lower ratio in comparison to the more rural parts of the state. </h4>

<h3>Map #3: Pretty Breaks</h3>
<h4>This map looks exactly the same as the Equal Interval Map, and it is hard to get an accurate idea of the ratios since a majority of the ratios fall bellow 200, so I would have needed a significant amount of classes.</h4>
