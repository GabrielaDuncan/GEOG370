    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>

    <p>Gabriela Duncan</p>
    <p>To complete this project, I took the World Projection Shapefile provided to us and used it as a vector in QGIS. From there, I adjusted the ESPG to show the different projections by clicking on the EPSG button in the lower right hand corner of the program. I then used the Indicatrix plug-in to add the indicatrix points, which changed shapes and sizes based off of the different projections that I used.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection makes countries and continents at higher latitudes (Canada, Russia) and lower latitudes (Antarctica) look wider than they are in reality. Also, Greenland is still a little big as it looks like it is about 1/2 of the size of Africa. (A</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is much more spherical than the previous projections, and the sizing of the countries and continents on this map seem to be relatively more equal given that the indicatrix points are all about the same size.</h3>

    <h2>Psuedo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection looks the most like the maps that I would see on the walls in schools. However, in class we discussed how this projection is imperialist as it is designed to make the Global South look significantly smaller than it is. For example, in this projection, Greenland is larger than South America and Africa. In reality, Greenland is only a fraction of the size of Africa.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel 1 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is one of the most 3D-like of all of the projections. The indicatrix points are relatively equal in size with the highest and lowest latitudes having slightly larger points.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Area Cylindrical Projection</h2>
    <h3>The indicatrix points are relatively the same shape and size until we get to the very high and low latitudes. In those areas, the indicatrix points are extremely stretched out.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>There is a giant gap in this projection, and the indicatrix points get more stretched out as the latitude values decrease.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is relatively similar to the World Equidistant Conic Projection above as the indicatrix points get more strecthed out as the ;atitude values decrease. However, unlike the previous projection, this globe is connected and does not have a large gap.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Equidistant Cylindrical</h2>
    <h3>The three middle rows of indicatrix points are more narrow than the top and bottom row of indicatrix points. Also, Greenland looks about 1/3 of the size of Africa in this projection. I chose this projection because it was the first one I saw that had significant changes in the indicatrix points in the middle of the projection and not at the top or bottom row like some of the previous projections.</h3>

    <h2>US Contiguous Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>I chose this projection because it was the most unique of all of the projections that I have encountered. However, there is a significantly large gap in this projection, which is kind of confusing to me. Similarily to EPSG 54027 and 102016, the indicatrix points get wider as the latitude values decrease.</h3>
