<h1>Homework 9: High School Dropout Rates of Washington </h1>
<h2>Gabriela Duncan</h2>
<h4>I originally had a hard time finding data, but somehow I came across this topic, and I was intrigued. When I started this assignment, I wanted to do something related to the environment, but I did not like any of the data. I thought that this topic was one of the most interesting, and I like how this data has me thinking about education inequality, even if it is in a state that I do not have much context with. Anyway, as you can see in the graph, the counties with the highest drop-out rates are Challam and Skamania counties. On the other hand, a couple of the counties with the lowest drop-out rates are Ferry and Lincoln county.</h3>
